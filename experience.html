        After finishing school, I worked as a barber in Kuala Terengganu. <br>I worked there for 2 months while waiting for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) exam results.<br> Various experiences I got while I worked there. <br>Like having a very high patience when dealing with fussy customers.<br> With this, I can make a variety of hairstyles and according to the customer's taste because I have mastered the guidance from brother Taufiq.<br> Now, I work part-time as a barber at TDM residential college at UITM Machang campus for TDM college students.
